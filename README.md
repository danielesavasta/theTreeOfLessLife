# The Tree of Less Life

This project is the graduation project of Çağla Dereli from the Visual Communication Design Department at İzmir University of Economics.

## About the Project

"The Tree of Less Life" is an information visualization that represents the loss of biological life diversity on our planet. The project aims to raise awareness about the alarming decline in biodiversity and its impact on ecosystems worldwide.

## Data Sources

The visualization is based on data acquired from the following sources:

- **Living Planet Index**: A global dataset tracking trends in the abundance of wildlife populations.
- **UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**: Data on global agricultural practices and their impact on biodiversity.
- **Forest Resources Assessment**: Comprehensive data on the state of the world's forests.
- **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations**: Insights into food production and its environmental consequences.
- **Historical Sources**: Contextual information on biodiversity loss over time.

## Purpose

This project combines data visualization and design to communicate complex environmental issues in an accessible and visually engaging way. It highlights the urgent need for action to preserve the planet's biodiversity for future generations.
